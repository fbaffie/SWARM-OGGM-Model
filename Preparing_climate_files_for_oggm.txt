Instructions for preparing the files for OGGM

Firstly the downloaded gcm files for temperature and precipitation must be converted from daily to monthly values.
This can be done using the following commands:

For precipitation,
cdo --timestat_date first -monsum -cat nameofdailyprecipfile.nc nameofoutputprecipfile.nc

For temperature,
cdo --timestat_date first -monavg -cat nameofdailytempfile.nc nameofoutputtempfile.nc

Have to include the timestat_date first part to ensure that all dates are the same time each month (may not be an issue now we're not merging them into a subsequent file)

Then edit the resulting netcdf files to ensure that the variables match the input data names.
Use,
ncdump -c filename
to see these details along with,
cdo info filename
to check that dates etc are there.

To change attributes of variables e.g. units ,
ncatted -a nameofattribute,variablename,o,c,newattribute inputfile.nc outputfile.nc
newattribute the whatever you want to change it to e.g. units,temp,o,c,degrees to change the temp attribute unit description to degrees

To rename a variable use,
ncrename -v oldvariablename,newvariablename inputfile.nc outputfile.nc

Finally the cdo montlhy output sometimes includes the time variable with units that can't be read (mainly due to the T00:00:00Z at the end).
This can be circumvented by renaming the units and removing the T and Z,
ncatted -a units,time,o,c,'days since 1949-12-01 00:00:00' inputfile.nc outputfile.nc

It can be temperamental at times about having the same input and output name when editing files so be aware that temp intermediate files may be needed.
