# SWARM OGGM Model
 A repository containing scripts for running OGGM for the SWARM project
 Currently contains: 
 1. A script for selecting and outputting the RGI glacier information selected by a shapefile
 2. A script for performing the mass balance calibration for a region either taking the data from an inputted csv file or downloading data from the wgms and filtering for only the relevant RGI region. This will eventually incorporate our own cliamte data.
 3. A script for selecting ice inversion by shapefile (work in progress)
